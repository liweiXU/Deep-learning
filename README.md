# Deep-learning
You can find more details of the specialisation from the site: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
/n Due to the Deep Learning Honor Code, it's not allowed to public my code on Github. So it's a pity that i can not present my code in this specialization.
But i would like to give a brief presentation of my working experience in this domain.

I have learned: 
1.Build & train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters, & implement efficient neural networks & deep learning to diverse applications
2.Train test sets & analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques & optimization algorithms, & build neural networks in TensorFlow
3.Build a CNN & apply it to detection & recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, & apply algorithms to image, video, & 2D/3D data
4.Build & train RNNs, work with NLP & Word Embeddings, & use HuggingFace tokenizers & transformer models to perform tasks like NER & Question Answering

The skills i gained:
1.Artificial Neural Network
2.Convolutional Neural Network
3.Tensorflow
4.Recurrent Neural Network
5.Transformers
