# Deep-learning
You can find more details of the specialisation from the site: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning  
Due to the Deep Learning Honor Code, it's not allowed to public my code on Github. So i can not present my code in this specialization.  
But i would like to give a brief presentation of my working experience in this domain.  

I have learned:   
1.Build & train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters, & implement efficient neural networks & deep learning to diverse applications  
2.Train test sets & analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques & optimization algorithms, & build neural networks in TensorFlow  
3.Build a CNN & apply it to detection & recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, & apply algorithms to image, video, & 2D/3D data  
4.Build & train RNNs, work with NLP & Word Embeddings, & use HuggingFace tokenizers & transformer models to perform tasks like NER & Question Answering  

The skills i gained:  
Artificial Neural Network   
Convolutional Neural Network   
Tensorflow   
Recurrent Neural Network   
Transformers  

Code mainly in Python
